# COMP-2710

## Course Description

COMP 2710 is highly schizophrenic in that it is both a course on managing the complexity of large systems and an applied programming class. Managing software complexity requires some knowledge of software process. Applied programming means that you will be required to critically analyze real-world types of problems, design algorithms, and then implement those algorithms in high-level code to solve problems. COMP 2710 is as much about learning to solve problems as it is about C++ Programming. This course requires organization, effort, and discipline. You should prepare for every class and bring LOTS of questions – COMP 2710 is not a passive viewing experience. If at any time you feel that you are falling behind, you should contact the instructor immediately and come to office hours frequently. The keys to success in this course are attending every class, starting on homework assignments as soon as they are assigned, actively studying for exams, and always requesting help in a timely fashion.

This course typically requires 9 hours of time per week, on average for the average student. If you don’t have it, drop.

## Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:
  + 1. Grasp both C++ Syntax and Semantics
  
  + 2. Develop software on Linux
  
  + 3. Use assertions and design by contract to develop high-reliability programs
  
  + 4. Understand concepts of data abstraction, efficiency, and memory management
  
  + 5. Understand how to perform unit and system-level testing
  
  + 6. Apply recursion to solve problems
  
  + 7. Compare and contrast mutability and immutability
  
  + 8. Understand concurrency programming
  
  + 9. Understand how to avoid deadlocks in programming


## Short Homework Assignments and Activities: 6 projects

These activities will be take-home in nature and designed to reinforce concepts taught in class. They will be due in writing at the beginning of class. An electronic copy may also be necessary (specified in the assignment). Generally, these assignments are designed to be low-risk in the sense that they are designed to assess thinking and effort, rather than to strictly punish errors.

  + 1. Write a “Flow of Control” program
  
  + 2. Learn test drivers, assertions, random numbers
  
  + 3. Use arrays, streams, and file I/O
  
  + 4. Use structures, linked lists, multiple versions, and functions
  
  + 5. Understand concurrency programming
  
  + 6. Understand deadlock avoidances
